A Spotify client application focused on discovering new music.

Demo: https://spotify-app-5bb09.web.app/login

The demo is intended to be viewed on a mobile device. It is still in progress and bugs do exist.

The homepage displays a scrolling list of the user's top artists and albums of the past month.

Five random genres from those artists are extracted and a playlist based on each one is provided. Tapping on a thumbnail will open a detailed view of the track and will play a 30 second preview. The user can perform actions such as liking the track, viewing the artist, and adding the track to their queue.

The explore page features a search bar and recommended music based on the user's recent listening history. Beneath that, an infinitely scrolling grid recommends music in order of increasing popularity to enable the discovery of more obscure music.
